PredictiveCollision
===================

A snippet of python code that solves collisions of circular objects using continuous (a priori) approach. Trajectories of the circles are straight lines. The code makes heavy use of linear algebra. Apart from standard library it depends on numpy and pygame, so make sure you install these dependencies before running it. WARNING -- the code is not fully debugged, there are many known issues, which will be addressed shortly
